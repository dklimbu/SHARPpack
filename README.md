# SHARP pack software package
SHARP pack, short for Surface Hopping And Ring Polymer package, is a highly-parallelized software with a modular structure that is developed for (1) helping development of approximate quantum dynamics methods and (2) simulating non-adiabatic dynamics in condensed phases subject to nuclear quantum effects.

## Installation
---
The SHARP pack software package can be downloaded from the Github repository. Create a folder and git clone this repository.
```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/dklimbu/sharppack.git
```

Once the package has been downloaded, navigate to the directory containing the package and run the following command:
```
$ make
```

## Prerequisite
---
The SHARP pack is tested under a Linux environment with an Intel Fortran compiler. Path for BLAS, LAPACK and FFTW3 libraries need to be provided.

## Usage
---
The SHARP pack software package includes several modules that can be used to perform different types of simulations and analysis. See SHARP Pack manual for more detail

## Examples
---
The SHARP pack software package includes several examples that demonstrate how to use the different method(s)/model(s). These examples can be found in the example/ directory of the package.
